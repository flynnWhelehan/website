    performance: <p>Me and John Costa were finalists at this hackathon and got the opportunity to present our project to everyone at the EasyA hackathon in San Francisco!</p>,
    summary: <p>It was my first time working with blockchain technology, and was a great learning experience. 
                In 36 hours, we made an ‘Invest-to-Earn’ project for blockchain based pension investment. 
                The idea is to drive pension capital towards sustainable causes using VeChainOfficial.</p>,
