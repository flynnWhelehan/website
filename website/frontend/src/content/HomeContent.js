          Delivering impactful .NET and Azure SaaS solutions specifically within the aviation industry. 
          My expertise lies in backend engineering, building robust RESTful APIs and event-driven microservices. 
          I use firsthand aviation domain knowledge (from MCC/CAMO operations) to architect practical, 
          high-value systems, including the development of an AI-powered data processing system.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research interests include knowledge representation, high-dimensional systems, 
          and modelling complex environments, with a focus on how AI operates meaningfully within multifaceted systems. 
          I'm deeply curious about the intersections of human cognition and computational systems.
