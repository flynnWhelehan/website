        <p>
          As a backend engineer in the SaaS aviation industry, 
          I'm experienced in developing APIs and event-driven 
          microservices with a strong focus on customer needs 
          and product outcomes. I incorporate aviation domain 
          knowledge to deliver practical, high-value solutions. 
          I work across teams to help build a high-performance 
          culture, bringing together solid engineering standards 
          and a clear sense of real-world impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research interests include knowledge representation, 
          high-dimensional systems, and modelling complex environments, 
          with a focus on how AI operates meaningfully within 
          multifaceted systems. I'm deeply curious about the 
          intersections of human cognition and computational systems.
