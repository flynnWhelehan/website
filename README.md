I am working on a portfolio-based website. I will primarily focus on front-end technologies to begin. It will be a place to share my creative side and showcase some of what I get up to, all while developing new skills through using some unfamiliar tools and techniques. 

I have lots of creative ideas for this project, and will steadily progress with it as I find the time.
