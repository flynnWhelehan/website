# Website - [The FW Project](https://flynnwhelehan.github.io/website/)
- Nov 2023 - Present

I am working on a portfolio-based website. Starting simple, it will be a place to showcase some of what I get up to, while trying out some new things. 
I have lots of creative ideas for this project, and will steadily progress with it as I find the time.
