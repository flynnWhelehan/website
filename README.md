# Website - The FW Project
- Nov 2023 - Present

I am actively working on a portfolio-based website. I will primarily focus on frontend technologies to begin. It will be a place to share my creative side and showcase some of what I get up to, all while developing new skills through using some unfamiliar tools and techniques. 

I have lots of creative ideas for this project, and will steadily progress with it as I find the time.
